    "In general, image data can be stored in either raster or vector graphics formats.  Vector graphics scale with the resolution of the device on which they are viewed, whereas the appearance of raster graphics is resolution dependent and cannot scale arbitrarily.  Vector graphics are typically used for graphical design applications whilst raster graphics are used for photographic images.  \n",

As medical images may be optical or non-optical (e.g. X-ray) we will also discuss the coversion between colour and grayscale.  At each point in the matrix of a colour (RGB) raster image a red (R), green (G) and blue (B) value is stored.  \n",

The fourth column would correspond to an $\\alpha$-value (A) which describes the opacity of the image and is utilised for overlaying multiple images.  We will not worry about $\\alpha$-values in this demonstration.  A PNG would typically be 32-bit (four bytes) per pixel for RGBA, with 8-bit integer precision per channel (R, G, B and A), per pixel.
